You can stream real-\\ntime data from any data source in JSON format via HTTP post. Stakeholder Dashboards can integrate with a variety of data\\nsources and enable you to represent data in several valuable perspectives. You can create custom dashboards, near real-time\\ndashboards, receive real-time updates, and access information from any device with a browser. \\nOPTIC Reporting \\nThe OPTIC Reporting capability provides you with all the artifacts required for IT infrastructure and event management. It\\nconsists of the following components - Operations Bridge Reporting Content, BVD Reports, Flex Reports and OPTIC Data\\nLake. It consolidates performance metrics, event metrics, and response time data into tables, graphs, and dashboards and\\nenables you to visualize and analyze your IT environment. OPTIC Reporting uses OPTIC One to create reports and visualize the\\nvisualize the real time data of the IT infrastructure. You can create the following reports. \\nBVD reports: BVD reports display visual information of historical or recorded data using tables, charts, and widgets. You\\ncan use Visio to create dashboards and attach data from data queries, which can retrieve data from any Vertica database\\nusing SQL queries. BVD reports are created in OPTIC One. \\nFlex reports: Flex Reports is web-based authoring that allows you to create dashboards and reports (eliminates the use of\\ntools such as visio). You can create and customize reports and dashboards based on your business needs.  Flex reports\\nare created in OPTIC One.\\nBYOBI reports: You can create custom reports using using the Business Intelligence (BI) tool of your choice. \\nYou can send data (performance metrics, events, and topology) from different sources to OPTIC Data Lake. You can represent\\nthis data graphically either on BVD or any other business intelligence tool (BYOBI) of your choice.\\nOperations Bridge offers several out of the box reports that you can view on BVD. These reports are available in the following\\ncategories: \\nSystem Infrastructure reports\\n: Use these reports to view information about the availability and performance of\\nphysical systems in your environment. You can also view information about the average utilization of resources for a\\nchosen period of time. You can use the Agent Metric Collector, Metric Streaming policies, or SiteScope to collect system\\ninfrastructure metrics. You can view historical data collected by AMC in the System Infrastructure reports. \\nSystem Infrastructure reports are downtime aware. The metrics received during planned downtime are excluded from\\ncalculations performed while aggregating data. \\nDowntime aware reports are currently available for system infrastructure metrics collected through AMC and SiteScope.\\nThey're not supported for Metric Streaming policies, BPM, and RUM.\\nEvent reports\\n: Use these reports to view statistics about the events that come into OBM from various data sources like\\nAgent metric collector, SiteScope, RUM, and BPM. Using these reports, you can gain insight into event trends, the severity\\nof events, and event assignments.\\nSynthetic Transaction reports\\n: Use these reports to view information about synthetic polling of end user experience,\\navailability, and performance of applications. You can use Business Process Monitor (BPM) to collect synthetic transaction\\nmetrics. \\nReal User Monitor reports\\n: Use these reports to view information about real end user experience, availability, and\\nperformance of applications. You can use Real User Monitor (RUM) to monitor real user behavior and collect the metrics.\\nAutomatic Event Correlation\\nThe Automatic Event Correlation capability provides you with all the artifacts required for event management, event\\nconsolidation, and noise reduction. This capability consists of OPTIC Data Lake.\\nAutomatic Event Correlation offers the facility to automatically correlate events coming from OBM, by analyzing patterns. This\\nautomatic event correlation (AEC) uses a machine learning algorithm to group related events into a single event and sends the\\ncorrelated event back to OBM. Thus, as an operator viewing the event console in OBM, you will be able to identify key events\\nthat can solve many underlying events.\\nMonitoring Control Center\\nMonitoring Control Center (MCC) is a new section of the Operations Bridge UI that consolidates the administration and\\nconfiguration of monitoring capabilities into a central user experience.

The data aggregation\\nand forecasting are configured by corresponding taskflows triggered by OPTIC Data Lake.\\nFor more information about Reporting data and task flows, see \\nDataAndTaskFlows\\n.\\nData source resiliency\\nWhen the Optic DL is unavailable and therefore unable to ingest metrics collected by Agent Metric Collector (AMC), AWS\\ncollector, Azure Collector, or Kubernetes collectors, the metrics are temporarily stored in the Store and forward database. After\\nthe OPTIC DL is up and running, the metrics stored in the Store and forward database are streamed to the Optic DL.\\nFor other data sources (Operations Agent, SiteScope, Management Packs, BPM, and RUM), the metrics are stored in their local\\nbuffers during OPTIC DL outage and are streamed to the OPTIC DL after it's up and running.\\nThe buffering mechanism for other data types is as follows:\\nHealth Indicator, KPI, and Event data are buffered in OBM’s relational database.\\nTopology data is forwarded to OPTIC DL using the Data Flow Probe. The Data Flow Probe stores the timestamp of the last\\nsuccessful sync. Once OPTIC DL starts accepting data again, the Data Flow Probe reads the topology data from the RTSM\\nserver and forwards it to OPTIC DL.\\nDowntime data is buffered in OBM's message bus.\\nFor information about configuring resiliency, see \\nConfigure data resiliency\\n. \\nEvent and performance management \\nAll events and metrics collected by different Operations Agent instances are sent to OBM. OBM stores these events and\\nmetrics in its own database. You can view the performance metrics using Performance Dashboards and events in the Events\\nconsole. This consolidated view helps you identify, isolate, and remediate issues before they become showstoppers.\\nData analytics\\nYou can generate meaningful insights from all the data stored in OPTIC Data Lake using analytics.\\nEvent correlation\\nIn a large environment, one of the biggest challenges is how to manage the large number of events that originate from a\\nvariety of sources. The aim is to identify the events that have a significant impact on business services. While it's essential to\\nminimize the number of events that appear, it's even more important to highlight the events that, if not managed\\nappropriately, could cause a breach in service level agreements (SLAs) and generate incidents in your help desk system.\\nEvent correlation entails the grouping of events based on some common pattern or identifier. There are two types of\\ncorrelation:\\nRule based event correlation - In this case, you can specify the rules or parameters based on which events get grouped or\\ncorrelated. You can use two rules to correlate events - one based on topology and the other based on the event stream.\\nRule based correlation is available in both classic and containerized OBM.  \\nAutomatic event correlation - In this case, you don't need to specify any rules. The Automatic Event Correlation service\\n(AEC) is a part of the Automatic Event Correlation capability. It identifies patterns among disparate events and creates a\\nsingle correlated event for a group of events. AEC is available if you install the Automatic Event Correlation capability.\\nAutomatic Event Correlation\\nAutomatic Event Correlation identifies repeated patterns in the incoming event flow over a period of time.

Over time, the Vertica database accumulates\\nan enormous amount of data from various data sources. You may need to delete the old and unused data periodically to free\\nup storage space.\\nYou can configure retention profiles per source or content category such that data older than the configured period is\\nautomatically deleted from Vertica database. \\nFor more information about configuring data retention, see \\nCustomize Data Retention\\n.\\nRAW and Aggregated data (e.g. hourly, daily, forecasting) are stored in Vertica to ease the reporting. The data aggregation\\nand forecasting are configured by corresponding taskflows triggered by OPTIC Data Lake.\\nFor more information about Reporting data and task flows, see \\nDataAndTaskFlows\\n.\\nData source resiliency\\nWhen the Optic DL is unavailable and therefore unable to ingest metrics collected by Agent Metric Collector (AMC), AWS\\ncollector, Azure Collector, or Kubernetes collectors, the metrics are temporarily stored in the Store and forward database. After\\nthe OPTIC DL is up and running, the metrics stored in the Store and forward database are streamed to the Optic DL.\\nFor other data sources (Operations Agent, SiteScope, Management Packs, BPM, and RUM), the metrics are stored in their local\\nbuffers during OPTIC DL outage and are streamed to the OPTIC DL after it's up and running.\\nThe buffering mechanism for other data types is as follows:\\nHealth Indicator, KPI, and Event data are buffered in OBM’s relational database.\\nTopology data is forwarded to OPTIC DL using the Data Flow Probe. The Data Flow Probe stores the timestamp of the last\\nsuccessful sync. Once OPTIC DL starts accepting data again, the Data Flow Probe reads the topology data from the RTSM\\nserver and forwards it to OPTIC DL.\\nDowntime data is buffered in OBM's message bus.\\nFor information about configuring resiliency, see \\nConfigure data resiliency\\n. \\nEvent and performance management \\nAll events and metrics collected by different Operations Agent instances are sent to OBM. OBM stores these events and\\nmetrics in its own database. You can view the performance metrics using Performance Dashboards and events in the Events\\nconsole. This consolidated view helps you identify, isolate, and remediate issues before they become showstoppers.\\nData analytics\\nYou can generate meaningful insights from all the data stored in OPTIC Data Lake using analytics.\\nEvent correlation\\nIn a large environment, one of the biggest challenges is how to manage the large number of events that originate from a\\nvariety of sources. The aim is to identify the events that have a significant impact on business services. While it's essential to\\nminimize the number of events that appear, it's even more important to highlight the events that, if not managed\\nappropriately, could cause a breach in service level agreements (SLAs) and generate incidents in your help desk system.\\nEvent correlation entails the grouping of events based on some common pattern or identifier. There are two types of\\ncorrelation:\\nRule based event correlation - In this case, you can specify the rules or parameters based on which events get grouped or\\ncorrelated. You can use two rules to correlate events - one based on topology and the other based on the event stream.\\nRule based correlation is available in both classic and containerized OBM.  \\nAutomatic event correlation - In this case, you don't need to specify any rules. The Automatic Event Correlation service\\n(AEC) is a part of the Automatic Event Correlation capability. It identifies patterns among disparate events and creates a\\nsingle correlated event for a group of events. AEC is available if you install the Automatic Event Correlation capability.\\nAutomatic Event Correlation\\nAutomatic Event Correlation identifies repeated patterns in the incoming event flow over a period of time. It creates a single\\ncorrelated event for all events within a pattern to represent the entire group of events.

You can use this as an example to send alerts from any other Prometheus Alertmanager in\\nyour environment, to Containerized OBM.\\nIt considers the following OOTB alerting rule for pod CPU usage.\\n- alert: KubernetesPodHighCPU\\n      annotations:\\n        description: The CPU usage of pod {{ $labels.namespace }}/{{ $labels.pod}}\\n          in instance {{ $labels.instance }} is high\\n          VALUE = {{ $value }} LABELS = {{ $labels }}\\n        summary: The CPU usage of pod {{ $labels.namespace }}/{{ $labels.pod}} is\\n          high\\n      expr: 100 * sum(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{container!=\"\", image!=\"\"}[1m]))\\n        by (pod) / sum(kube_pod_container_resource_limits{resource=\"cpu\"}) by (pod)\\n        > 80\\n      for: 5m\\n      labels:\\n        severity: info\\nThe severity \\ninfo\\n in the alerting rule corresponds to \\nNormal\\n severity in OBM Event Browser. When the CPU usage of a pod\\nexceeds the configured threshold (80), an event of \\nNormal\\n severity appears in the OBM Event Browser. \\nPrerequisites\\nMake sure you\\'ve installed and configured Monitoring capability in OMT. For more information, refer \\nOMT documentation\\n. \\nMake sure that you have deployed the Containerized OBM capability.\\nMake sure that you have the permissions to run \\nkubectl\\n commands on the OMT cluster.\\nSend Prometheus alerts to OBM\\nYou must integrate Prometheus Alertmanager with OBM to send the Prometheus alerts to OBM. Perform the following steps to\\nsend high pod CPU usage alerts to OBM:\\nStep 1: Import Prometheus Alertmanager content pack into OBM\\nPrometheus Alertmanager content pack includes the Prometheus Alertmanager policy. This policy contains rules to map the\\nPrometheus Alertmanager alerts to the OBM events.\\nPerform the following steps to import the Prometheus Alertmanager content pack into OBM:\\n1\\n. \\nDownload the Prometheus Alertmanager content pack from the following location:\\nOn Linux:\\nwget --no-check-certificate https://<externalAccessHost>:<externalAccessPort>/staticfiles/Monitoring_Service_Prometheus_Alert_Manager_Content_Pack_xxxx.xx.xxx.zip \\nOn Windows:\\nhttps://<externalAccessHost>:<externalAccessPort>/staticfiles/Monitoring_Service_Prometheus_Alert_Manager_Content_Pack_xxxx.xx.xxx.zip\\n2\\n. \\nOn OBM user interface, go to \\nAdministration\\n > \\nSETUP AND MAINTENANCE\\n > \\nContent Packs\\n.\\n3\\n. \\nClick \\nImport\\n. The Import Content Pack window appears.\\n4\\n. \\nBrowse to the location where you have saved the Prometheus Alertmanager content pack and then click \\nImport\\n. The\\nPrometheus Alertmanager content pack gets imported. Click \\nClose\\n.\\nStep 2: Deploy Prometheus Alertmanager Integration policy\\nFollow these steps to deploy Prometheus Alertmanager Integration policy:\\n1\\n. \\nOn OBM, go to \\nAdministration\\n > \\nMonitoring\\n > \\nPolicy Templates\\n.\\n2\\n. \\nSelect \\nTemplate by Type\\n > \\nEvents\\n > \\nEvent from REST Web Service\\n.\\n3\\n. \\nIn the middle pane, expand \\nPrometheus Alertmanager Integration\\n and select the version.\\n4\\n. \\nClick \\nAssign\\n \\nand Deploy\\n.

              "  <Document: {'content': 'Prepare using the guided install script\\nThis method is available only for embedded Kubernetes.\\nThe application installer consists of the guided install script. This script simplifies the application deployment by configuring\\nthe prerequisites required to deploy the application. This reduces the complexity of setting up the database, storage, and OMT\\ndeployment and the time to deploy the application.\\nYou can use this script only in the scenario where you plan to deploy your infrastructure to have OMT with the NFS capability\\nenabled, external PostgreSQL and Vertica that are TLS enabled, and local persistent volumes with a single separate disk\\ndevice for all the LPVs on each worker node. For more information, see \\nGuided installation of OMT and Operations Bridge\\nStep 3: Configure the application specific prerequisites on the infrastructure\\nIn this step, you must configure the application specific prerequisites. The application prerequisites vary based on the\\ncapabilities that you have chosen to deploy and the products that you want to integrate with. \\nFor example, the following diagram illustrates the specific prerequisites that you must complete to deploy Operations Bridge. \\nIn this step, you must complete the application specific requirements by doing certain configurations on the infrastructure you\\nprepared in step 2.\\nFor example, in step 2 you would have installed and configured a database engine on the database host(s) with TLS. In this\\nstep, the application would require that you create certain databases on the database engine based on the capabilities. You\\nwould typically run several SQL queries to create the users and databases. Similarly, another example would be, in step 2, you\\nwould have installed a load balancer software on the load balancer host(s). In step 3, the application would require you to edit\\nthe load balancer configuration file and forward the ports according to the application documentation.\\nTo complete the application specific prerequisites, you must follow the steps described in the Set up prerequisites section.\\nAdding additional capabilities \\nFor adding additional capabilities, you will need to make just the incremental changes. To add additional capability:\\n1\\n. \\nObtain the resources\\n: Obtain only the additional resources required for the application or capability that you want to\\ndeploy based on the estimates provided by the sizing calculator.\\n2\\n. \\nPrepare infrastructure\\n: You can leverage the existing infrastructure. This means that you will need only expand an\\nexisting infrastructure configuration. For example, depending on the capability you want to deploy you may need to add\\nadditional worker nodes in the cluster, increase the storage, or configure additional ports.\\n3\\n. \\nConfigure the application specific prerequisites\\n. After you complete the infrastructure configuration, you will need\\nto complete only the prerequisites required for the application or the specific capability.\\nSome resources such as storage and database servers are common prerequisites for the applications.

The following illustration provides a conceptual overview of\\ncommon dependencies between different applications.

For the latest documentation, always see\\nhttps://docs.microfocus.com\\n.Prepare using the guided install script\\nThis method is available only for embedded Kubernetes.\\nThe application installer consists of the guided install script. This script simplifies the application deployment by configuring\\nthe prerequisites required to deploy the application. This reduces the complexity of setting up the database, storage, and OMT\\ndeployment and the time to deploy the application.\\nYou can use this script only in the scenario where you plan to deploy your infrastructure to have OMT with the NFS capability\\nenabled, external PostgreSQL and Vertica that are TLS enabled, and local persistent volumes with a single separate disk\\ndevice for all the LPVs on each worker node. For more information, see \\nGuided installation of OMT and Operations Bridge\\nStep 3: Configure the application specific prerequisites on the infrastructure\\nIn this step, you must configure the application specific prerequisites. The application prerequisites vary based on the\\ncapabilities that you have chosen to deploy and the products that you want to integrate with. \\nFor example, the following diagram illustrates the specific prerequisites that you must complete to deploy Operations Bridge. \\nIn this step, you must complete the application specific requirements by doing certain configurations on the infrastructure you\\nprepared in step 2.\\nFor example, in step 2 you would have installed and configured a database engine on the database host(s) with TLS. In this\\nstep, the application would require that you create certain databases on the database engine based on the capabilities. You\\nwould typically run several SQL queries to create the users and databases. Similarly, another example would be, in step 2, you\\nwould have installed a load balancer software on the load balancer host(s). In step 3, the application would require you to edit\\nthe load balancer configuration file and forward the ports according to the application documentation.\\nTo complete the application specific prerequisites, you must follow the steps described in the Set up prerequisites section.\\nAdding additional capabilities \\nFor adding additional capabilities, you will need to make just the incremental changes. To add additional capability:\\n1\\n. \\nObtain the resources\\n: Obtain only the additional resources required for the application or capability that you want to\\ndeploy based on the estimates provided by the sizing calculator.\\n2\\n. \\nPrepare infrastructure\\n: You can leverage the existing infrastructure. This means that you will need only expand an\\nexisting infrastructure configuration. For example, depending on the capability you want to deploy you may need to add\\nadditional worker nodes in the cluster, increase the storage, or configure additional ports.\\n3\\n. \\nConfigure the application specific prerequisites\\n. After you complete the infrastructure configuration, you will need\\nto complete only the prerequisites required for the application or the specific capability.\\nSome resources such as storage and database servers are common prerequisites for the applications. Consider setting up\\nthese prerequisites upfront or as needed over a period of time. The following illustration provides a conceptual overview of\\ncommon dependencies between different applications. This illustration shows that you can prepare the base infrastructure for\\nall applications by combining the common system requirements.

The\\nKubernetes node also acts as the master, worker, and optionally hosts the NFS service and embedded PostgreSQL\\ndatabase.  \\nHorizontal scaling out from this deployment model (moving to another deployment model or adding a Vertica node) is\\ncurrently not supported for additional load, load balancing, or HA.\\nThere is a potential data loss risk from databases (PostgreSQL/Oracle and Vertica) during an ungraceful shutdown.\\nIt's recommended to take frequent backups to avoid data loss.\\nThe following table details some potential implications of deploying OpsBridge OPTIC Reporting in a low footprint and possible\\nrecovery options.\\nContainerized Operations Bridge 2022.11\\nPage \\n162\\nThis PDF was generated on 30/11/2022 05:05:56 for your convenience.

In this scenario, OPTIC AppHub\\ndisplays the \\nMissing Digital Signature\\n message. This means OPTIC AppHub couldn’t find the provenance file in the chart directory\\nbecause it's not an official chart or it may have been removed to circumvent the authenticity check. You can still deploy an\\nunsigned chart, but you must acknowledge that you accept the risks associated with deploying a chart that isn't verified.\\nContainerized Operations Bridge 2022.11\\nPage \\n169\\nThis PDF was generated on 30/11/2022 05:05:56 for your convenience.

              "  <Document: {'content': \"Storage related infrastructure\\nThis topic provides you the required specifications to configure the storage server requirements. \\nIf a container stops or restarts, all changes made inside the container are lost. To save information such as configuration files\\nand databases, the information must be stored external to the container in an entity called Persistent Volume (PV) within the\\ncluster. \\nTo decide the size for each of the disks, refer to the sizing calculator. \\nThe cluster components (say a Pod) access a storage volume in the following flow:\\nPod -> PVC -> PV-> Storage ( for example, NFS)\\nA PV is a storage object in a cluster that maps to a physical storage for example, an NFS server volume. When you create a PV,\\nthe mapped physical storage volume becomes available in the Kubernetes cluster. The cluster components use this storage for\\npersistent data storage. However, they don't use a PV for their storage directly. They in turn use an object called Persistent\\nVolume Claim (PVC). A PVC is an intermediary between the application requesting a particular storage of a specific type and\\nthe PV representing a physical volume in the cluster.\\nPVCs are owned by applications and are automatically created when you deploy the application. However, a PVC must be\\nbound to a PV and this binding is done by Kubernetes. To enable kubernetes to bind a PV to a PVC the PV’s either have to be\\ncreated manually upfront, or through a storage provisioner. If you choose to use a storage provisioner, Kubernetes uses the\\nprovisioner to create PV’s on demand based on PVCs that are created while deploying the application. The following two\\nsections describe two ways of creating PVs.\\nStatic provisioning without storage provisioner\\nIn this scenario, the PVC is directly bound to the persistent volumes. You must create the PVs before deploying the application.\\nThe following diagram illustrates the relationship between the physical storage and the Kubernetes storage objects.\\nDynamic provisioning with storage provisioner\\nYou can also set up dynamic volume provisioning, which creates storage volumes (the PVs) on demand.

To save information such as configuration files\\nand databases, the information must be stored external to the container in an entity called Persistent Volume (PV) within the\\ncluster. \\nTo decide the size for each of the disks, refer to the sizing calculator. \\nThe cluster components (say a Pod) access a storage volume in the following flow:\\nPod -> PVC -> PV-> Storage ( for example, NFS)\\nA PV is a storage object in a cluster that maps to a physical storage for example, an NFS server volume. When you create a PV,\\nthe mapped physical storage volume becomes available in the Kubernetes cluster. The cluster components use this storage for\\npersistent data storage. However, they don't use a PV for their storage directly. They in turn use an object called Persistent\\nVolume Claim (PVC). A PVC is an intermediary between the application requesting a particular storage of a specific type and\\nthe PV representing a physical volume in the cluster.\\nPVCs are owned by applications and are automatically created when you deploy the application. However, a PVC must be\\nbound to a PV and this binding is done by Kubernetes. To enable kubernetes to bind a PV to a PVC the PV’s either have to be\\ncreated manually upfront, or through a storage provisioner. If you choose to use a storage provisioner, Kubernetes uses the\\nprovisioner to create PV’s on demand based on PVCs that are created while deploying the application. The following two\\nsections describe two ways of creating PVs.\\nStatic provisioning without storage provisioner\\nIn this scenario, the PVC is directly bound to the persistent volumes. You must create the PVs before deploying the application.\\nThe following diagram illustrates the relationship between the physical storage and the Kubernetes storage objects.\\nDynamic provisioning with storage provisioner\\nYou can also set up dynamic volume provisioning, which creates storage volumes (the PVs) on demand. For more information\\nabout dynamic volume provisioning, see \\nKubernetes documentation\\n.  If you use dynamic volume provisioning to create the\\nvolumes on demand, make sure that the provisioner is able to offer the storage with\\nthe \\nReadWriteOnce\\n and \\nReadWriteMany\\n access modes. For more information on the access modes,  see \\nKubernetes\\ndocumentation\\n.\\nYou can also have multiple storage provisioners, for example, one storage provisioner which is able to create PVs with access\\nmode \\nReadWriteMany\\n and another one with access mode \\nReadWriteMany\\n.

As a prerequisite, you must make sure to allow an L3 Bi\\ndirectional connection between the remote system and AWS or Azure setup to access application services. You can do this\\nusing a VPN connection or Direct Connect. If L3 communication isn't enabled between the remote system and AWS or Azure\\nsetup, you must create an environment in the same VPC or VNet to access application services. You must set up a private\\nDNS zone. \\nYou can either create a private domain or use an existing private domain in \\nRegister domain\\n. For steps to create a private\\ndomain, see the \\nAWS documentation\\n or \\nAzure documentation\\n. You will use this record name for the external access host\\nconfiguration.\\nIn AWS, you can either create a self-signed certificate or use an existing certificate. In the AWS Management Console, search\\nand click \\nCertificate Manager\\n. Import the certificate for the external access host. Once you upload the certificate, it will\\nappear as imported in the AWS Certificate manager tab. You will give this certificate details for\\nthe \\nserverCrt\\n and \\nserverKey\\n parameters when configuring the load balancer for OMT and application.\\nRequired Ports\\nServices can be exposed over a node port or a load balancer.

It's recommended to use External\\nVertica as the store for all production purposes.\\n Skip this topic if you are using the Vertica container. Embedded\\nVertica is supported during evaluation only.\\nFor all production deployments, it's recommended to use external Vertica deployments with a minimum of three\\ndedicated nodes for High Availability, load balancing, and fault tolerance. \\nIf you are planning to deploy the application in a VMware environment, it's recommended that the virtual machines have\\npolicies applied that end the VM suspension or the VM migration (for example VMware vMotion) while \\nMicro Focus\\nsoftware is running on it.

OPTIC Data Lake uses Vertica to store data. To populate data into the OPTIC Data Lake\\nyou must connect to the Vertica database.\\nIn this documentation, you will install Vertica for OPTIC Data Lake on systems or VMs that are separate from your\\napplication master (control plane) and worker nodes refers to as External Vertica. It's recommended to use External\\nVertica as the store for all production purposes.\\n Skip this topic if you are using the Vertica container. Embedded\\nVertica is supported during evaluation only.\\nFor all production deployments, it's recommended to use external Vertica deployments with a minimum of three\\ndedicated nodes for High Availability, load balancing, and fault tolerance. \\nIf you are planning to deploy the application in a VMware environment, it's recommended that the virtual machines have\\npolicies applied that end the VM suspension or the VM migration (for example VMware vMotion) while \\nMicro Focus\\nsoftware is running on it. A slow vMotion on a Vertica or an OPTIC Management Toolkit (OMT) node VM may cause\\nnetworking timeouts between management VMs that lead to problems with the OMT cluster or \\nMicro Focus\\n software\\nrunning on it. For more details about Vertica on VMware, see \\nVertica in a Virtualized Environment\\n.\\nTo install and set up a new Vertica database perform the following:\\n1\\n. \\nMake sure that you have computed resources and storage using the Sizing calculator.\\n2\\n. \\nYou can tune the TCP/IP stack for network performance on the system where you plan to install Vertica for the production\\nenvironment, useful in scaled out networks.\\na\\n. \\nAs the root user, edit the \\nsysctl.conf\\n file in the \\n/etc/\\n directory and set the following parameters:\\n#Sets the receive socket buffer maximum size in bytes.\\nnet.core.rmem_max = 16777216\\n# Increase number of incoming connections\\nnet.core.somaxconn = 1024\\n#Sets the receive socket buffer default size in bytes.\\nnet.core.wmem_default = 212992\\n#Sets the send socket buffer maximum size in bytes.\\nnet.core.wmem_max = 16777216\\n#Sets the maximum number of packets allowed to queue when a particular interface receives packets faster than the kernel can process them.\\n# increase the length of the processor input queue\\nnet.core.netdev_max_backlog = 100000\\nnet.ipv4.tcp_mem = 16777216 16777216 16777216\\nnet.ipv4.tcp_rmem = 8192 262144 8388608\\nnet.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 8192 262144 8388608\\nnet.ipv4.udp_mem = 16777216 16777216 16777216 \\nnet.ipv4.udp_rmem_min = 16384\\nnet.ipv4.udp_wmem_min = 16384\\nvm.dirty_ratio = 5\\nvm.swappiness = 1\\nb\\n. \\nThe parameters updated in step 1 take effect after restart. However, if you want to avoid restarting, run the following\\ncommand to load the file:\\nsysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf\\nThis will instantly update the parameters.\\nFor information on recommended network tuning parameters for the Vertica cluster, see \\nTuning the TCP/IP Stack\\nin the \\nVertica Hardware Guide\\n.\\n(\\nOptional\\n) You may choose to run the following command to verify the updated values of the parameters:\\nsysctl net.core.netdev_max_backlog net.core.rmem_max net.core.somaxconn net.core.wmem_default net.core.wmem_max net.ipv4.tcp_mem net.ipv4.tcp_rmem net.ipv4.tcp_wmem net.ipv4.udp_mem net.ipv4.udp_rmem_min net.ipv4.udp_wmem_min vm.dirty_ratio vm.swappiness\\n3\\n. \\nEnsure that you have obtained the information about the supported Vertica version and downloaded the Vertica package\\nfrom the \\nSoftware Licenses and Downloads\\n website.\\n4\\n. \\nSee the following Vertica documentation sections before you install Vertica:\\nVertica documentation link\\nDescription\\nInstalling Vertica on cloud\\n or\\nInstall manually\\nContains information to install Vertica based on your platform.\\nRecommendations for Sizing\\nVertica Nodes and Cluster\\nContains recommendations for hardware for your Vertica nodes.

If you use the settings\\nsupported in earlier versions, you can give the input through environment variables. However, to edit the settings\\nprovided with this version you must create a \\ndbinit_conf.yaml\\n file and edit the settings. It's recommended to use \\nge\\nnconfig\\n as it supports all the settings that you can configure through \\ndbinit.sh\\n script.\\nImportant\\n: \\nYou can edit the \\ndbinit_conf.yaml\\n and edit the parameters and values as required by the\\napplication.\\nRemoving resource pool configuration from the configuration file won't cause \\ndbinit.sh\\n to remove the resource\\npool from Vertica. You must manually remove the pool from Vertica or you can set all the values to zero to disable\\nthe resource pool.\\n\\ue91b\\n\\ue91b\\nContainerized Operations Bridge 2022.11\\nPage \\n202\\nThis PDF was generated on 30/11/2022 05:05:56 for your convenience.

              "  <Document: {'content': \"Create PV manually\\nTo install the Operations Bridge in the Helm mode, you need to create Persistent Volumes (PVs).\\nYou can consider PVs as a mapping to a storage volume, for example, an NFS server volume in this case. When you create a\\npersistent volume, the storage volume becomes available in Kubernetes. The cluster components use this storage. The cluster\\ncomponents directly don't use a PV for their storage. They use something called a PVC (Persistent Volume Claim). You can\\nthink of PVC as an intermediary between the cluster components and the actual storage volume. The PVC will then bind to the\\nPV, or in simpler words, use the PV. The cluster components then use the PVC instead.\\nThis makes the cluster components (say a Pod) access a storage volume in the following flow:\\nPod -> PVC -> PV -> Storage Volume (ex.

              "  <Document: {'content': 'Create local persistent volumes on worker nodes\\nIf you are going to deploy the OPTIC Reporting capability using embedded kubernetes, then you will be installing OPTIC Data\\nLake. The OPTIC DL Message Bus requires Local Persistent Volumes (LPVs) for runtime data persistence. This storage gets\\nallocated from filesystems on your worker nodes. There are three LPVs required on each worker node (\\nledger, bookkeeper\\n, and \\nz\\nookeeper\\n LPV). \\nThe exact number of worker nodes required for any deployment that\\'s not an evaluation is given in the sizing calculator or the\\nDeployment Architecture\\n topic in this documentation. If you require High Availability (HA), then you must allocate the LPVs to\\nat least three worker nodes and also allocate an extra worker node if one of the three workers is lost out of the cluster\\npermanently for some reason. A single worker node is supported for use in Evaluation and Low footprint OPTIC Reporting\\ndeployment only. \\nDuring this step, you will be configuring the LPVs on each worker node. The options are set up in slightly different ways:\\nConfigure separate disk devices for each LPV on every worker node\\n: Using three separate disk devices per\\nworker node, one for each LPV shown by the sizing calculator, is recommended for best performance. You will add empty\\ndisk devices to all your worker systems, each sized so that enough free space will result when a filesystem is installed to\\naccommodate the output from the sizing calculator for the \\nledger, journal, zookeeper\\n LPVs according to your expected scale.\\nUse a single separate disk device for all LPVs on every worker node\\n: One separate disk device common for all\\nLPVs on each worker node is also supported. You will add one empty disk device on your worker systems which should be\\nsized for filesystem free space more than the sum of the sizes for the\\n ledger, journal, zookeeper\\n LPVs, based on the output\\nfrom the sizing calculator.\\nUse the space under one of your existing worker disks\\n: Using an existing disk device to mount LPVs is supported\\nfor non-production deployments and Low footprint OPTIC Reporting deployment only. Note that using an existing\\nfilesystem may have lower performance, and space utilization of the LPVs could impact the system or applications after\\nsome time.\\nDepending on your choice, follow one of the below sections to mount the filesystems so they will be ready for the software\\ninstallation.\\nIn all cases, note that:\\nThe default OPTIC Data Lake path to mount the LPV filesystems under is\\n /mnt/disks.\\n You can choose a non-default OPTIC\\nData Lake path but it must be identical on all the workers where you create LPVs. The OPTIC Data Lake path should be\\nowned by root and have \\n0755\\n permissions. When deploying OPTIC Data Lake for the first time, make sure these\\ndirectories are empty.\\nThe three directories under the OPTIC Data Lake path you create below for LPVs will be owned by \\nSYSTEM_USER_ID\\n \\nand\\n \\nSY\\nSTEM_GROUP_ID.\\n For the ID values, see the application \\ninstall.properties\\n file. The default values are 1999 and 1999\\nrespectively. The LPV directory permissions will be set below to 755.\\nThe filesystems hosting the LPVs can be either \\next4 or xfs.\\nEach of the three directories you create under the OPTIC Data Lake path must be separate mount points, with\\ncorresponding lines in your\\n /etc/fstab\\n. This is to make sure all three directories are seen in the output of the \"mount\"\\ncommand even after reboots.\\nThe parent LPV mount directory mustn\\'t be directly mounted in \\n/\\n. You must create a directory in \\n/\\n and use that as the\\nparent LPV mount directory. For example, create a directory \\nmntdisk\\n in \\n/\\n and then create the \\nnewdisk\\n as the LPV\\nmount directory.\\nThe first section below describes how to configure separate disk devices on each node to dedicate to each of your LPVs. The\\nsecond section describes how to configure one single separate disk device on each node to use for LPVs. The third section\\ndiscusses using an existing mounted filesystem that has ample space, for non-production and Low footprint OPTIC Reporting\\ndeployment use only.\\nConfigure separate disk devices for each LPV on worker nodes\\nThis section covers the recommended procedure for production use where you have added three additional disk devices, one\\nfor each LPV (on ESX they would be new “hard disks”) on all your worker nodes.\\n1\\n. \\nLog on to a worker node as root or \\nSUDO\\n as root.\\n2\\n. \\nRun the following command to create a new directory as the OPTIC Data Lake path, under which you will mount\\nfilesystems:\\nmkdir -p <mount path>\\nFor example:\\nmkdir -p /mnt/disks\\nNote:\\n If you deploy OPTIC Data more than once then it\\'s recommended to create LPVs for each OPTIC Data Lake\\ndeployment on each worker node as OPTIC Data Lake instances run on different worker nodes.\\nImportant:\\n Add disks to the worker nodes with a minimum 10% extra space on top of the size recommended for\\nLPV disks by the sizing calculator. \\nFor example, if the size of LPV recommended for \\nledger\\n is 100 GB and 20 GB each for \\nbookeeper\\n and \\nzookeeper\\n,\\nadd disks with size of 110 GB, 22 GB, and 22 GB respectively.\\nContainerized Operations Bridge 2022.11\\nPage \\n221\\nThis PDF was generated on 30/11/2022 05:05:56 for your convenience.

Therefore, it\\'s highly\\nrecommended to add new attributes at the end of the list and to avoid deleting attributes.\\nIf the forwarding script has any syntax errors, the events won\\'t be forwarded.\\nFollow these steps to add CMAs to the forwarding script:\\n1\\n. \\nGo to \\nOBM > SETUP AND MAINTENANCE > Connected Servers\\n.\\n2\\n. \\nSelect \\nExternal Event Processing\\n.\\n3\\n. \\nClick \\nManage Scripts\\n.

This parameter should be a readable\\nstring and is used to identify the OBM system when checking the registered OBM systems in the suite. \\n--suite-service-hostname\\n: Defines the FQDN of the system on which OBM can reach the \\nitom-di-receiver-svc\\n service. This\\nis typically the FQDN of the control plane (master) node.\\n--obm-ca-cert-alias\\n: After you install additional trusted certificates on OBM, it's recommended to use only the OBM CA\\ncertificate to configure the suite. To prevent an import of all trusted certificates from OBM into the suite, ensure that\\nyou specify the CA certificate alias by using the parameter, \\n--obm-ca-cert-alias\\n.\\nPassword parameters: You're prompted for passwords if you haven't specified them on the command line.\\nThe following optional parameters are updated with the default settings or operations if they're not specified:\\nNote: \\nYou can't use the \\nobm-configuration.jar \\ntool to configure a containerized OBM system.\\n\\ue916\\n\\ue916\\nNotes: \\nThe event forwarding from the OBM to OPTIC Data Lake is enabled immediately after you configure OBM. It's\\npossible that OBM immediately tries to forward events to the configured OPTIC Data Lake, while OPTIC Data\\nLake and the suite are still not configured. This might result in some warning events that mention that the\\nevent forwarding to OPTIC Data Lake has failed.\\nWhen you rerun the tool, it might abort because the suite certificates are already installed when the tool was\\nexecuted previously. In such a situation, add the \\n--force\\n parameter. The inclusion of the --force parameter in\\nthe command ensures that the tool execution proceeds even when the suite certificates are installed. Ensure\\nthat you rerun the tool with this parameter only when the installed certificates are from the current suite,\\nwhich was installed when the tool was run previously.\\nNote:\\nIf you add BVD after integrating through \\nobm-configurator.jar\\n tool fails due to duplicate servers then\\nupdate the DNS entry for the server. Run the following command:\\nopr-connected-server.bat -username -password -update -dns itom-di-receiver-svc\\nTo find the ID of the connected server, run the following command:\\nopr-connected-server.bat -list -username -password\\n\\ue916\\n\\ue916\\nImportant\\n: In cloud deployments, the default ports for DI Receiver, DI Data Access, and DI\\nAdministration are 30001, 30003, and 30004 respectively. If you didn't use the\\n Cloud Automation\\nToolkit\\n provided by Micro Focus and instead provisioned your cloud infrastructure manually using\\ndifferent ports, then specify these ports explicitly with the corresponding parameters that are mentioned.\\nContainerized Operations Bridge 2022.11\\nPage \\n352\\nThis PDF was generated on 30/11/2022 05:05:56 for your convenience.

The recommended storage to provision volumes for Message Bus is block storage.\\nMessages ingested to OPTIC Data Lake are synced to storage before sending response to clients. To ensure low latency to\\nclients, multiple volumes are used by OPTIC Data Lake Message Bus. There are three volumes that are used by OPTIC Data\\nLake:\\nJournal: \\nJournal volume is used to achieve durability. Sequential writes are performed on journal volume when a\\nmessage is received by Message Bus.\\nLedger:\\n Data is kept in ledger volumes till applications consume the messages. Writes to ledger volume happens in the\\nbackground and data is indexed and stored in this volume. Fast random I/O operations happen on ledger volumes.\\nZookeeper:\\n Zookeeper stores metadata information. The requests sent to Zookeeper are persisted to volume attached\\nto every instance of Zookeeper. Low latency disk writes are essential for good performance of Zookeeper. Configure\\nstorage to provision volumes that meet these needs.\\nIn some deployments you may not have block storage provisioned. In such deployments it's recommended to use local\\nstorage. If there are difficulties in provisioning disks for local storage you can use NAS/NFS volumes. However, there are some\\nlimitations that you must consider before using the NAS/NFS volumes. NAS usually displays wide variation in latencies which\\nmakes it difficult to provide a consistent performance on production deployments. Also, most of the NFS file systems aren't\\nPortable Operating System Interface for UNIX (POSIX) compliant. Using non-POSIX compliant filesystems may result in some\\ndata loss. \\nAll other OPTIC Data Lake services require volumes for logging. It's recommended to use shared file system storage so that\\nlogs are available in a single storage for all the components.\\nMapping of all the capabilities and storage selectors\\nThe following table provides a mapping of capabilities and storage selectors for all the capabilities available in Operations\\nBridge, if you are deploying on an Embedded Kubernetes provided by Optic Management Toolkit (OMT).

              "  <Document: {'content': 'Storage concepts\\nThis topic provides you a background on the Kubernetes storage concepts and the storage requirements of Operations Bridge. \\nPersistent volume and persistent volume claim\\nIf a container within cluster stops or restarts, all changes made inside the container are lost. To save information such as\\nconfiguration files and databases, the container must store the information in an external storage. This external storage is\\nrepresented in Kubernetes as a Persistent Volume (PV).\\nThe cluster components (say a Pod) access a storage volume in the following flow:\\nWhen you create a PV, the mapped physical storage volume is available in the Kubernetes cluster. An application requests for\\na particular storage in the form of a PVC. Kubernetes determines a corresponding available PV that matches the requested\\nstorage of the PVC and makes it available to the pod.\\nKubernetes supports different types of volumes including awsElasticBlockStore, Azure Disk, iSCSI, local storage, NFS. In\\nOperations Bridge, few volumes are based on block storage. They can be mounted to only one pod at a time. This is known as\\naccess mode \\nReadWriteOnce\\n (\\nRWO\\n). A few volumes are based on shared filesystem storage. This can be mounted and accessed\\non multiple pods at the same time. This is known as access mode \\nReadWriteMany\\n (\\nRWX\\n). For more information on the access\\nmodes, see \\nKubernetes documentation\\n.\\nThe following table gives a mapping of supported storage types and access mode in Operations Bridge:\\nSupported storage types\\nAccess Mode\\nNFS, Ceph RBD, EBS, Azure Disk\\nReadWriteOnce\\nNFS, Cephfs, Azure Files, EFS\\nReadWriteMany\\nYou must create the PVs manually before deploying the application, or they can be dynamically created through a storage\\nprovisioner. If you choose to use a storage provisioner, Kubernetes uses the provisioner to create PVs on demand based on\\nrequested PVCs that are created while deploying the application.\\nDynamic provisioning with storage provisioner\\nDynamic volume provisioning creates storage volumes (the PVs) on demand. For more information about dynamic volume\\nprovisioning, see \\nKubernetes documentation\\n. \\nYou can also have multiple storage provisioners, for example, one storage provisioner which is able to create PVs with access\\nmode \\nReadWriteOnce\\n and another one with access mode \\nReadWriteMany\\n,\\n \\nor for different performance characteristics. Refer to\\nthe documentation of your Kubernetes environment to see what type of storage classes are available. For example, while\\ndeploying Operations Bridge on AWS, \\nio2\\n storage class represents fast throughput volumes and \\ngp3\\n storage class represents\\nother volumes. If you are using OMT Embedded Kubernetes, you can use the NFS storage provisioner with the storage class as \\ncdf-nfs\\n.\\nWhen you use a storage provisioner, the application requests storage by stating the corresponding storage class in its PVC\\nrequest. The dynamic storage provisioner responsible for a specific storage class creates a new storage volume and the\\ncorresponding PV that represents the storage. The PV is bound to PVC and the PVC can be used by application.\\nThe following diagram illustrates how the provisoning of a PV happens through a storage class. \\nFor detailed information on storage concepts in Kubernetes see \\nStorage\\n.\\nStorage requirements for OPTIC Data Lake\\nContainerized Operations Bridge 2022.11\\nPage \\n452\\nThis PDF was generated on 30/11/2022 05:05:56 for your convenience.

This service is available after you install the Edge chart.\\nMonitoring Service Edge collects metrics from the Operations Agent (OA) nodes connected to an OBM. Therefore, it must be\\nconnected to the same\\n \\nOBM that the OA nodes are connected. So you must integrate the OBM with the OpsBridge deployment\\nbefore deploying the Edge chart. You can deploy the Edge chart onto a single node \\nK3s\\n environment using the \\ninstall.sh\\n script\\nor manually on MF Kubernetes with CDF environment. After installing the Edge chart, you must establish trust between\\nMonitoring Service Edge and OBM. This enables the Agent Metric Collector in the Monitoring Service Edge to collect metrics\\nfrom the Operations Agent nodes and forward them to OPTIC DL on the  OpsBridge deployment.\\nThis section gives you information to:\\nIntegrate OpsBridge with OBM\\nInstall Monitoring Service Edge on K3s using a script\\nInstall Monitoring Service Edge on OpenShift\\nInstall Monitoring Service Edge on MF Kubernetes with OMT\\n \\nEstablish trust between Monitoring Service Edge and OBM\\nPrerequisites\\u200b\\u200b\\n You must have the following information to perform an Edge deployment, irrespective of whether it's K3s, OpenShift, or\\nOMTK8s):\\nOBM tenant FQDN, port, protocol\\nAgent Metric Collector credentials.

When you create a\\npersistent volume, the storage volume becomes available in Kubernetes. The cluster components use this storage. The cluster\\ncomponents directly do not use a PV for their storage. They use something called a PVC (Persistent Volume Claim). You can\\nthink of PVC as an intermediary between the cluster components and the actual storage volume. The PVC will then bind to the\\nPV, or in simpler words, use the PV. The cluster components then use the PVC instead.\\nThis makes the cluster components (say a Pod) access a storage volume in the following flow:\\nPod -> PVC -> PV -> Storage Volume(ex.

Stakeholder Dashboards can integrate with a variety of data\\nsources and enable you to represent data in several valuable perspectives. You can create custom dashboards, near real-time\\ndashboards, receive real-time updates, and access information from any device with a browser. \\nOPTIC Reporting \\nThe OPTIC Reporting capability provides you with all the artifacts required for IT infrastructure and event management. It\\nconsists of the following components - Operations Bridge Reporting Content, BVD Reports, Flex Reports and OPTIC Data\\nLake. It consolidates performance metrics, event metrics, and response time data into tables, graphs, and dashboards and\\nenables you to visualize and analyze your IT environment. OPTIC Reporting uses OPTIC One to create reports and visualize the\\nvisualize the real time data of the IT infrastructure. You can create the following reports. \\nBVD reports: BVD reports display visual information of historical or recorded data using tables, charts, and widgets. You\\ncan use Visio to create dashboards and attach data from data queries, which can retrieve data from any Vertica database\\nusing SQL queries. BVD reports are created in OPTIC One. \\nFlex reports: Flex Reports is web-based authoring that allows you to create dashboards and reports (eliminates the use of\\ntools such as visio). You can create and customize reports and dashboards based on your business needs.  Flex reports\\nare created in OPTIC One.\\nBYOBI reports: You can create custom reports using using the Business Intelligence (BI) tool of your choice. \\nYou can send data (performance metrics, events, and topology) from different sources to OPTIC Data Lake. You can represent\\nthis data graphically either on BVD or any other business intelligence tool (BYOBI) of your choice.\\nOperations Bridge offers several out of the box reports that you can view on BVD. These reports are available in the following\\ncategories: \\nSystem Infrastructure reports\\n: Use these reports to view information about the availability and performance of\\nphysical systems in your environment. You can also view information about the average utilization of resources for a\\nchosen period of time. You can use the Agent Metric Collector, Metric Streaming policies, or SiteScope to collect system\\ninfrastructure metrics.

The metrics received during planned downtime are excluded from\\ncalculations performed while aggregating data. \\nDowntime aware reports are currently available for system infrastructure metrics collected through AMC and SiteScope.\\nThey're not supported for Metric Streaming policies, BPM, and RUM.\\nEvent reports\\n: Use these reports to view statistics about the events that come into OBM from various data sources like\\nAgent metric collector, SiteScope, RUM, and BPM. Using these reports, you can gain insight into event trends, the severity\\nof events, and event assignments.\\nSynthetic Transaction reports\\n: Use these reports to view information about synthetic polling of end user experience,\\navailability, and performance of applications. You can use Business Process Monitor (BPM) to collect synthetic transaction\\nmetrics. \\nReal User Monitor reports\\n: Use these reports to view information about real end user experience, availability, and\\nperformance of applications. You can use Real User Monitor (RUM) to monitor real user behavior and collect the metrics.\\nAutomatic Event Correlation\\nThe Automatic Event Correlation capability provides you with all the artifacts required for event management, event\\nconsolidation, and noise reduction. This capability consists of OPTIC Data Lake.\\nAutomatic Event Correlation offers the facility to automatically correlate events coming from OBM, by analyzing patterns. This\\nautomatic event correlation (AEC) uses a machine learning algorithm to group related events into a single event and sends the\\ncorrelated event back to OBM.
