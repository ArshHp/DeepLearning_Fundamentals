Djawadi also evolved the themes with the characters, noting in a 2017 interview that Daenerys\\' theme \"initially plays on a couple of instruments on top of the Dothraki music. It’s almost like it doesn’t have its own identity yet.

Since then, his various intrigues have directly caused several major events that have impacted Westeros, including the framing of Tyrion Lannister for the attempt on Bran Stark's life, the downfall of Lord Eddard Stark, the deaths of Lord Jon Arryn and King Joffrey Baratheon, and the War of the Five Kings.\\n\\n\", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 0}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '186f29e83a7d51855aa4cfded4f33355'}>,\n",

The collective can itself be modified by number as a new noun declension, for example \\'\\'azantys\\'\\' \"knight, soldier\" (nom. sing.)→ \\'\\'azantyr\\'\\' \"army\" (nom. coll.); \\'\\'azantyr\\'\\' \"army\" (nom. sing.)→ \\'\\'azantyri\\'\\' \"armies\" (nom. pl.).\\n\\n', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 4}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': '1b2ef5b42bb13d872e7858b5dd823610'}>,\n",

On Illyrio's advice, Tyrion decides to seek out and join Aerys' surviving daughter Daenerys at Meereen and help her reclaim the Iron Throne. He eventually realizes that two of his traveling companions are not what they seem. One is Jon Connington, disgraced former Hand of the King; the other claims to be Aegon VI Targaryen, Aerys' grandson, whom Varys had spirited away and replaced with another baby that was then killed during the Lannisters' sack of King's Landing. While stopping at a trading town to rest on their way to Volantis, Tyrion visits a brothel and is recognized and captured by Jorah Mormont who believes that delivering a Lannister to Daenerys will return Jorah to her good graces. Before they can reach Meereen, they are captured by the slavers currently besieging the city. When a plague strikes the slavers' siege camps, Tyrion engineers their escape by joining a mercenary company, the Second Sons. \", 'content_type': 'text', 'score': None, 'meta': {'_split_id': 14}, 'id_hash_keys': ['content'], 'embedding': None, 'id': 'a5eaac70274d42b478ca5b5a48ee0023'}>,\n",
